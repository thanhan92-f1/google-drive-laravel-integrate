## Quick Start

If you prefer to install this package into your own Laravel application, please follow the installation steps below

## Installation

#### Step 1. Install a Laravel project if you don't have one already

https://laravel.com/docs/installation

#### Step 2. Require the current package using composer:

```bash
composer require funnydevjsc/google-drive-laravel-integrate
```

#### Step 3. Create a Google Service credentials:

- As our guide at https://github.com/funnydevjsc/google-client-laravel-integrate.

#### Step 4. Publish the controller file and config file

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="FunnyDev\GoogleDrive\GoogleDriveServiceProvider" --tag="funnydev-google-drive"
```

If publishing files fails, please create corresponding files at the path `config/google-drive.php` from this package.

#### Step 5. Update the various config settings in the published config file:

- After publishing the package assets a configuration file will be located at <code>config/google-drive.php</code>.
- Find your Google Drive parent folder ID and fill into <code>config/google-drive.php</code> file like this (your files and folders might be uploaded and managed within this parent folder):
